Given a set of cities and distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest 
possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Input:  N cities (1<=N<=100) and M connections between cities.
	In the next following M lines, each line represents 2 cities and the cost to travel between them.
Output: Shortest route and the cost.

Example:
Input: 	4 6
	1 2 3
	1 3 2
	1 4 1
	2 3 1
	2 4 2
	3 4 4
Output: 1->3->2->4->1
	Cost: 6
