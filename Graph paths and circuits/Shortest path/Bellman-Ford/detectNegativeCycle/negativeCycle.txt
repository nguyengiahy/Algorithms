Given a directed graph with N (<=1000) vertices and M connections.
Determine whether the graph has negative cycle.

Input: 
- first line: N, M
- M following lines: each line contains 3 positive integers u, v and weight of the edge connecting u and v.
Output:
- "Yes" if negative cycle was found.
- "No" is negative cycle was not found.

Example:
- Input: 
4 5
1 2 5
1 3 4
2 4 3
3 2 -6
4 3 2
- Output:
Yes
