Given a directed graph with N (<=1000) vertices, M connections, source vertex s and destination vertex f.
Find the shortest path to travel from s to f and the total distance of that path.

Input: 
- first line: N, M, s, f
- M following lines: each line contains 3 positive integers u, v and weight of the edge connecting u and v.
Output:
- Shorstest path from s to f and the total distance of that path.

Example:
- Input: 
6 7 1 4
1 2 1
1 6 20
2 3 2
3 6 3
3 4 20
5 4 5
6 5 4
- Output:
Distance from 1 to 4: 15
