Hamilton circuit is a path that starts from 1 vertex and traverses all vertices and finally comeback 
to starting vertex. 
Given an undirect graph with N (<=100) vertices and M connections. List all Hamilton circuits start from vertex 1 
in the given graph.

Input:
- first line: N, M
- M following lines: 2 positive intergers u, v indicating there is an edge between u and v.
Output:
- All Hamilton circuits start from vertex 1.

Example:
Input:
5 6
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 5
4 1
5 2
Output:
1 3 5 2 4 1
1 4 2 5 3 1
