Given an undirected graph with N (<=100) vertices and M edges. Find a spanning tree of that graph.

Input:
- first line: N, M
- M following lines: each line contains 2 positive integers u,v indicating an edge connects u to v.
Output:
- edges of the spanning tree.

Example:
Input:
5 6
1 2 
1 3
1 5
2 3
3 4
3 5
Output:
Edges of the spanning tree:
(1,2)
(2,3)
(3,4)
(3,5)
