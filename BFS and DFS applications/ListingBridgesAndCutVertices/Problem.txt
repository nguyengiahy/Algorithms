Given an undirected graph with N (<=100) vertices and M connections. Find bridges and cut vertices in the graph.

Input:
- first line: N, M
- M following lines: each line contains 2 positive integers u, v indicating there is an edge between u and v.
Output:
- List of bridges
- List of cut vertices

Example:
Input:
