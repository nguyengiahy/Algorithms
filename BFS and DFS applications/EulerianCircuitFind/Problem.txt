Given an undirected graph with N (<=100) vertices and M connections, it can be either simple graph or multigraph. 
The graph is guaranteed to have a Eulerian circuit. Find the Eulerian circuit that exists in the graph.

Input:
- first line: N, M
- M following lines: each line contains 3 positive integers u, v, k indicating there are k edges between u and v.
Output:
- order of vertices in the Eulerian circuit.

Example 1:
Input:
5 5
1 2 1
1 3 2
1 4 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
Output:
1 2 3 1 3 4 1

Example 2:
Input:
6 9
1 2 1
1 3 1
1 5 1
1 6 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
3 5 1
5 6 1
4 5 1
Output:
1 2 3 1 5 3 4 5 6 1
