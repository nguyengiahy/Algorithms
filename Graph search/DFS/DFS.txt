Given a graph with N vertices, M edges, start point s, finish point f. Find all vertices that can be visited 
from s, and the path from s to f.

Input:
- first line: N(<=100), M, s, f
- following M lines: each line contains 2 positive integers u and v, represents a connection between u and v in
the graph.
Output:
- list of vertices can be visited from s.
- path from s to f.

Example:
Input: 	8 7 1 5
	1 2
	1 3
	2 3
	2 4
	3 5
	4 6
	7 8
Output: From 1 you can visit:
	2,3,4,5,6,
	The path from 1 to 5:
	1->2->3->5
