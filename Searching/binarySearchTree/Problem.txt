Build a binary search tree (BST) from a given array and perform node delete functionality.

Input: 	n
	n array elements
	Value you want to delete
Output: BST inorder traversal
	BST after a node is deleted

Example:
Input: 	6
	50 20 30 40 60 10
	Value you want to delete: 30
Output: 10 20 30 40 50 60
	Inorder traversal of the modified tree:
	10 20 40 50 60
