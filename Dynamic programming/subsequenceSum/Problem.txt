Given an array with n (1<=n<=1000) integers and a positive integer k (k<=1000). Find length of the longest subsequence 
whose sum is divisible by k, list all elements of that subsequence and the sum of that subsequence.

Input: 
- first line: n, k (seperated by a space)
- second line: n integers
Output:
- first line: length of the longest subsequence whose sum is divisible by k
- following lines: elements of the subsequence
- last line: sum of that subsequence

Example:
Input:	6 3
	8 4 10 13 5 7
Output: 5
	a[6] = 7
	a[4] = 13
	a[3] = 10
	a[2] = 4
	a[1] = 8
	Sum: 42
