Given a positive integer N <= 100, find how many ways to split N to a sum of positive integers. 
Permutations are considered as only 1 way.
(Note: 0 = 0 is still considered as 1 way to split N)

Input: N, 0 < N <= 100
Output: number of ways to split N to a sum of positive integers.

Example:
Input: N = 6
Output: 11

Explain:
6 = 1+1+1+1+1+1
6 = 1+1+1+1+2
6 = 1+1+1+3
6 = 1+1+2+2
6 = 1+1+4
6 = 1+2+3
6 = 1+5
6 = 2+2+2
6 = 2+4
6 = 3+3
6 = 6
