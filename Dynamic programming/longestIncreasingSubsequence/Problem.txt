Given an array A[1..n] (n <= 10^6, -10^6 <= a[i] <= 10^6).
Find the longest increasing subsequence of that array.

Input: 
- first line: n
- second line: a[1], a[2],..., a[n]. Seperated by a space.
Output:
- first line: length of the longest increasing subsequence.
- second line: elements of that subsequence.

Example:
Input: 	11
	1 2 3 8 9 4 5 6 20 9 10
Output: 8
	1 2 3 4 5 6 9 10
